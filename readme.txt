-- Run NdDrive.py to see the effect of different number of active D2D pairs on Throughput 

-- Run distanceDrive.py to see the effect of different distances between D2D pairs on Throughput 

-- Run movingDriver.py to see the throughput with moving devices (assuming 1/3 are driving, 1/3 are walking and 1/3 are static)

-- Run movingWOAllo.py to see the throughput with moving devices (assuming 1/3 are driving, 1/3 are walking and 1/3 are static) and without allocation except for the begining and end of the program.

-- Run plot.py to plot a hexagonal cell with randomly generated CUs and D2D pairs 

-- Change values in config.json to see the effect they have on the throughput
